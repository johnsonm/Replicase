Replicape case in OpenSCAD

No grill is provided for the fan. It mounts to the outside of
the case, so there is no use in having an integrated grill on the
inside.  Many grill designs are available for fans, printable and
manufactured, and the user must select one with appropriate safety
for their fan and situation.

The Beaglebone with Replicape should snap into the case, and the
case should snap together.

Use M3 x 6mm-8mm or #4-40 x 1/4" to mount the beaglebone in the bottom
if you are not satisfied with the clips.
